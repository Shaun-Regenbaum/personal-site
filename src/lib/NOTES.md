# Notes:

We are going to want a function to go to every hebrewbooks page for shas and scrape the html and store it in supabase.
After that we want to extract the shas text and preserve new lines and store it in supabase.
After that we want to experiment with hosting daf-renderer on our page.

How long should that all take?
