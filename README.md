# Todo:
1) I am not really liking the color theme or style right now. It feels very clunky and doesn't get that 'breezy' feeling im after. Maybe a gradient is what I need.

2) How should I manage posts? Ideally I want to take a markdown file and convert it to a page using dynamic parameters, but what is the right way to do that in svelte?
